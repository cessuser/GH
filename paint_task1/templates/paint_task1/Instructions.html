        Please read the following instructions carefully.
    </p>

    <p>
        This is an experiment in decision-making. The amount of money you earn will depend upon
        the decisions you make, and on the decisions other participants make. Your earnings are given
        in tokens. This experiment has 3 parts. Your total earnings will be the sum of your payoffs in
        each part. At the end of the experiment you will be paid IN CASH based on the exchange rate

    </p>

    <p>
        £1 = 400 tokens.
    </p>

    <p>
        In addition, you will be paid £5 for participation. Everyone will be paid in private and you are
        under no obligation to tell others how much you have earned.
    </p>

    <p>
        Please do not talk or communicate wvith other participants during the experiment or look at other
        participants’ computer screens. If you have a question, feel free to raise your hand, and an experimenter
        will come to help you.
