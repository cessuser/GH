    Earning Task

    <p>
        At the start of each period, you will be asked to perform an Earnings Task. This task consists of correctly
        answering questions about the number of digits displayed on your screen within 90 seconds. Once you provide
        the correct answer, you can move on to the next question. For each correct answer, you will receive 10 raw
        points. If you give three incorrect answers in a row, you will have 10 raw points deducted from your total
        number of raw points. This deduction is intended to prevent you from guessing.

    </p>
    <p>
        Once the time has lapsed, all participants will be ranked within their group based on the number of raw
        points they collected in the Earnings Task. This means that there will be a ranking for all participants from
        the Klee-Bazille group, a ranking for all participants from the Klee-Boch group, and a ranking for all
        participants from the Kandinsky-Boch group.

    </p>
    <p>
        Each participant will then receive the following earnings in each round based on the ranking within their group:
            Participants in the top 25% receive 800 tokens;
            Participants in the next 25% receive 600 tokens;
            Participants in the second-to-last 25% receive 400 tokens;
            Participants in the bottom 25% receive 200 tokens.
    </p>
    <p>
        You will be informed of the number of tokens you will receive in this period.
    </p>
    <p>
        This task is repeated in the subsequent periods. The only difference is that the difficulty of the task will
        be adjusted based on your previous performance. If you performed well, the questions will become more difficult.
        This adjustment will also occur for other participants based on their performance.
