    <p>
        After the outcome of the competition is revealed, you and the other participants will be asked to choose between
        two tax and transfer schemes for the decision group. This section explains how the schemes work and how the tax
        and transfer scheme will be chosen for each decision group.


    </p>
    <p>
       Under the tax and transfer schemes, each participant will pay taxes over their earnings and each participant will
        receive a number of tokens as a transfer. In one scheme, everyone pays 20% of taxes over their earnings and
        everyone receives 100 tokens per person. In another scheme, each participant pays 40% of taxes over their
        earnings and each participant receives 200 tokens.


    </p>
    <p>
       If the participant with 400 tokens lost the competition, they will lose 40 tokens of their earnings before taxes.

    </p>
    <p>
        The net income of each participant is, therefore, calculated as follows:
    </p>
    <p>
        earning minus loss from competition (if applicable) minus tax payment plus transfers.

    </p>
    <p>
       Each participant will choose in private which scheme they want to apply to the group. The computer will then
        randomly select one of these decisions and apply it to all participants in the decision group. Each decision
        is equally likely to be drawn.
    </p>
    <p>
        Two rounds per period will be randomly selected by the computer for computing payoffs. Each round is equally
        likely to be drawn.
    </p>
    <p>
        Each decision and each outcome are independent of each of your other decisions. This means that your decisions
        and outcomes in one round will not affect your outcomes in any other round.
    </p>
    <p>
        You will Ô¨Ånd out your payoff from Part 2 at the end of the experiment.
